1) This app is created using Angular v17 with Angular material and a node.js server using Express.js. I have created my own mock server with dummyData required to run the application.
2) To run this app first clone or download the zip
3) Inside the server run 'npm install' to install necessary packages.
4) Run 'npm run dev' to start the server.
5) On the client folder run 'npx ng serve' to start the angular app.
6) Only admin role has access to chat. Credentials for login can be found inside dummyData.js in the server folder. The users can chat with each other and a group chat is created where all the users can chat with each other.
7) Application runs on localhost:4200.
